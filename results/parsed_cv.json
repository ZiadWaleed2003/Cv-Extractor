Developed a four-agent crew: a Job Analyst for query creation, a Searcher using the Tavily API, a Scrutinizer leveraging the FireCrawl API for deep scraping, and a Report Generator. Architected a robust backend with FastAPI and integrated multiple LLM providers (Gemini 2.0 Flash, NVIDIA NIM(Qwen3), OpenRouter(DeepSeek-R1)) for enhanced flexibility and performance. Containerized the application with Docker for a full-stack deployment with a React frontend on AWS EC2.",
